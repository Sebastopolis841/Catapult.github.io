            <p>Ballistas were in general very large and very powerful crossbows.
                Made to fire a 6 foot long arrow or rock with perilous accuracy.
                The ballista was great for long range attacks and was used in sieges to take out enemy defense and offense.
                While it took longer to load than a bow, it was far more powerful and could fire a much larger projectile.
