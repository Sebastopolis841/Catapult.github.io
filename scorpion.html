            <h2>How it's built</h2>
            <p>A scorpion catapult was made up of a wooden or metal base and used ropes to build and store potential energy in the arms of the catapult.
                Since the scorpion was used to attack people, it was designed to be more accurate and less powerful than other catapults. 
                It was also designed to be more compact and easier to carry around.
