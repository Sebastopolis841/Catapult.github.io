            <p>Onagers were powerful and heavy seige machines used by the Romans to hurl
                masive rocks and stones at enemy fortifications. They were used to break through
                the walls of enemy fortresses and castles, as well as to destroy enemy
                fortifications. The onager was a type of catapult that used twisted sinuw or rope to store energy and launch projectiles.
                 The onager was a powerful and effective weapon that was used in many battles.

            <h2>How it's built</h2>

            <p>An onager consists of a large frame of wood, with a wooden pole holding a container passing through a rope bundle which contains a projectile. To launch it, the wooden pull was pulled down and then suddenly released against the tension of multiple ropes and slings, firing the projectile forwards extremely fast.</p>
